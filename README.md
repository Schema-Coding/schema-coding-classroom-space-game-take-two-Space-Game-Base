## Intro to pip
Just like we've used Microsoft Windows' package manager `winget` to install packages and programs, python (and most other modern programming languages) come with their own package manager that lets developers share code with each other and get rid of that pesky problem of having to code mountains of stuff other people (who are probably smarter than you) have already figured out.

One "crazy fact programmers don't want you to know" is that we are generally lazy and do only what we absolutely need to and either find a way for the computer or other people to automate everything away for us. Nowadays, that means using someone else's framework and gluing libraries that do all the heavy lifting together.

Anyways, where were we? Oh yes, back to package managers... Python has one called "pip" that can download, install, and update python **libraries** for us. Libraries are just collections of code objects that are specially designed so that other people can easily use them (similar to how we built a fraction class that performs all fractional math for us).
